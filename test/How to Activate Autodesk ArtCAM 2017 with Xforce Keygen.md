You can preview your design in different materials and lighting conditions, and export it to various formats for machining, printing, or sharing.
 
Some of the features of Autodesk ArtCAM 2017 are:

- Relief creation: You can create high-quality reliefs from images, vectors, or scanned data. You can also use the relief wizard to generate reliefs from height maps or grayscale images.
- Vector editing: You can use the vector tools to draw and edit shapes, such as lines, curves, circles, polygons, and text. You can also use the vector doctor to repair and optimize your vectors.
- Sculpting: You can use the sculpting tools to add details and textures to your reliefs. You can also use the smoothing, blending, erasing, and carving tools to refine your design.
- Modeling: You can use the modeling tools to create complex 3D shapes from simple primitives, such as spheres, cylinders, cones, and tori. You can also use the boolean operations to combine, subtract, or intersect shapes.
- Rendering: You can use the rendering tools to preview your design in different materials and lighting conditions. You can also use the ray tracing option to generate realistic shadows and reflections.
- Exporting: You can export your design to various formats for machining, printing, or sharing. You can also use the post processor manager to customize the output for your specific machine.
