# How to Download and Use NI OPC Servers
 
OPC Servers is a software add-on for LabVIEW that converts proprietary industrial protocols to the open OPC Classic and OPC Unified Architecture (UA) protocols. OPC Servers provide a single, consistent interface to communicate with multiple devices through the OPC standard. In this article, we will show you how to download and use NI OPC Servers for your LabVIEW applications.

## Downloading NI OPC Servers
 
To download NI OPC Servers, you need to have a valid service agreement with NI. You can use this [download page](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.opc-servers.html) to access OPC Servers and all available editions are available from this download page. You can also find support information, such as documentation, release notes, and code examples on this page.
 
The latest version of NI OPC Servers is 2016, which supports Windows 10/8.1/7/Vista/XP (32-bit and 64-bit), LabVIEW 2016 or later, and various industrial protocols, such as Modbus, DNP3, IEC 61850, and Siemens S7. The file size of the download is 426.95 MB.
 
## Using NI OPC Servers
 
To use NI OPC Servers, you need to install it on your computer and activate it with your serial number. You can then launch the NI OPC Servers Configuration Manager from the Start menu or from LabVIEW. The Configuration Manager allows you to create and manage OPC projects, which contain the settings and information for communicating with your devices.
 
You can use the Configuration Manager to add devices, configure communication parameters, browse device tags, test connections, and monitor data. You can also import and export OPC projects for backup or sharing purposes.
 
To access the data from your devices in LabVIEW, you need to use the LabVIEW DSC Module or the LabVIEW OPC UA Toolkit. The LabVIEW DSC Module provides VIs and functions for creating OPC clients that can read and write data to OPC servers. The LabVIEW OPC UA Toolkit is a software add-on for LabVIEW that contains the OPC UA API that integrates secure and reliable communications. You can use this toolkit to create OPC UA clients and servers, as well as security management.
